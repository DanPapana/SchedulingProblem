# SchedulingProblem

A simple program written in C that solves the Scheduling problem, also known as the Job-shop problem. The problem is to schedule the tasks on the machines so as to minimize the length of the scheduleâ€”the time it takes for all the jobs to be completed. There are several constraints for the job shop problem: No task for a job can be started until the previous task for that job is completed.
